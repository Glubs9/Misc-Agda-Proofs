module Completeness where

-- note: before reading this proof please realize that i'm very tired and
-- sad and this is the stupidest proof i've ever written. it doesn't even
-- make sense? like point-free programming? point-free programming doesn't
-- mean anything. It's haskells prelude pointfree programming. Much less
-- fun

-- I want to prove the completeness of point free programming
-- cause i always felt like point free was too restrictive, but like it's
-- not though? It should be fully complete (i guess i'm doing completeness
-- but whatever)

-- I am going to do this with two proofs.
-- The first that we can generate every combination of functions (ala
-- untyped-lambda calculus)
-- Cause if we can, then we can express everything
--
-- Although we are finished there I wanted to make it more interesting, as
-- although, lambda calculus is turing complete, it is a little impractical
-- to code in literally. I am going to then write up primtive and general
-- recursion ala peano arithmetic completely pointfree to show that we can
-- do non-trivial computation on data-structures.
--


-- first we do lambda calculus, which we do by writing ski calculus

          --out = foldr1 ($) (x z, y z)
          -- out = fst fs' (snd fs') -- this is the same fucking equation lmao
          --xD = uncurry ($) (x z, y z)
          -- something like curry $ join bimap ($z)
          -- wtf does that even mean?

          -- benis = join bimap ($ z)

          -- uwu = uncurry ($) . (curry (join bimap))
          -- uwu = uncurry ($) . _ (join bimap $) fucking hell something
