-- idk i think it would be fun to write and prove HoTT stuff here.

-- chapter 1 (normal dependent type theory stuff)

-- note: this might not be an adequate definition of == as I think Higher inductive types create custom definitions.
-- we will get to this when it becomes a problem I guess
data _==_ {n : Level} {A : Set n} : A -> A -> Set n where
    refl : {a : A} -> a == a

-- the question becomes, do we specify things in this language, or do we try to prove theorems in agda which are equivalent to HoTT theorems
-- I am going with just proving things in agda as rewriting an entire type theory in agda seems like a chore

    <_,_> : A -> B -> A x B

curry : {n : Level} {A B C : Set n} -> (A -> B -> C) -> (A x B -> C) -- works as pair recursion rule (almost)
curry f < a , b > = f a b

recAxB C f < a , b > = f a b

indAxB C g a b = g < a , b >

data unit : Set where -- I'm pretty sure this is set_-2 but idk how to write that in agda (or at least can't be bothered. Probably a theorem)
    * : unit

-- note: we do not define the recursor on unit because it's SUPA! useless
